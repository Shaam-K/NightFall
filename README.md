# NightFall :

## Introduction and About :


    This is my 12th Standard CSC project, where the use of python is mandatory. I made this repository to store all my source code.

* Project : Weather App

    My project named **Nightfall** allows you to gather data that is being broadcasted by weather stations as often as 2.5 seconds. All you have to do is type the name of the city in the search bar and you will be able to see information about the weather in graphical representation.

*  Languages / Frameworks Used:

    * HTML 
    
    * CSS
        * W3.CSS
        
    * JAVASCRIPT
        * CHART.JS

    * PYTHON
        * DJANGO

## Description of each technology used:

* API : 
    * Also called Application Programming Interface where it acts as the intermediate between 2 applications. For 
      example, you can say that API is the waiter at the hotel, you ask him for food which in this case is "data" and the cook which is the "system / database" makes it for you based on what you asked.

    * API technology especially RESTful (REST is a method like HTTP) based ones are revolutionary as without it 
      developers would have to download extremely large files of data, and most of the data collected would be outdated after sometime. 

    * Example of an API :(api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?id=524901&appid={API key}) 
      click on the link to see what an API looks like

    * Most API's require an API KEY which is used for authorisation so that other people cant send commands on 
     your application.

    * I used openweather as my API, it specializes in delivering weather data
